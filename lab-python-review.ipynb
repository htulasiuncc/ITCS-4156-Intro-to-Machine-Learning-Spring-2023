    "```\n",
    "[expression for item in list]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here the `[]` brackets indicate list comprehension and our output will be a list, `expression` represents code that will run and its output will be stored in our list, and `for item in list` loops through each item in the iterable object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's test list comprehension by creating a list that contains the numbers 1-10. Recall that `range(1,11)` creates a sequence of numbers. These numbers are given in the form of a Python [generator](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/) that we loop over. (Recall, a generator creates the numbers on the fly instead of creating them all at once and filling up memory.)"

    "An important and sometimes confusing concept regarding NumPy arrays is copying. There are typically two methods for copying arrays (and copying in general): shallow copying and deep copying.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Shallow copying* either copies the object or elements memory addresses such that if a copied element is changed then the change is reflected in the original and vice-versa. Further, NumPy allows for what they call *views* or *slices*. Views or slices can be naively thought of as shallow copies of an entire or only part of an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "> View/Slice: An array that does not own its data, but refers to another array’s data instead. For example, we may create a view that only shows every second element of another array:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Deep copying* make stores data in a new memory address such that if we make changes to a copied object or element the changes are **not** reflected in the original and vica-versa.\n",

    "Next, let's review what [normal or Gaussian distribution](https://machinelearningmastery.com/statistical-data-distributions/) is while also practicing some equation to code conversion. Now this weeks math review didn't mention normal distributions but we did lightly cover probability distributions. Recall **a probability distribution is a list of outcomes and their associated probabilities**. Meaning, **a distribution is simply a collection of values or frequencies for a given observation**, like age of a population. A normal distribution is a specific type of probability distribution which looks like the following.\n",

    "Further recall a normal distribution has the parameters $\\mu$ (referred to as mu) which represents the mean and $\\sigma$ (referred to as sigma) represents the standard deviation. Throughout the semester we'll frequently make the assumption that our data is normally distributed. This is because many natural phenomena are like age, height, test-scores, IQ scores, sum of the rolls of two dices and so on follow normal distributions, thus making such an assumption reasonable. As normal distributions are found in so many different places they are one of the important probability distribution in statistics and machine learning!\n",
