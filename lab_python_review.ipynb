    "The basic outline for list comprehension is as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[expression for item in list]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here the `[]` brackets indicate list comprehension and our output will be a list, `expression` represents code that will run and its output will be stored in our list, and `for item in list` loops through each item in the iterable object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's test list comprehension by creating a list that contains the numbers 1-10. Recall that `range(1,11)` creates a sequence of numbers. These numbers are given in the form of a Python [generator](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/) that we loop over. (Recall, a generator creates the numbers on the fly instead of creating them all at once and filling up memory.)"

For those interested, see this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34142485/difference-between-numpy-dot-and-python-3-5-matrix-multiplication) on the differences between the methods.

Complete this TODO by creating a class called `CosineSimilarity` which computes the cosine similarity (angle between two vectors) between any two vectors. You are **NOT** allowed to use any existing libraries to compute the angle, however you can use NumPy to compute the square root, arccos, and to convert your radians to degrees.\n",
